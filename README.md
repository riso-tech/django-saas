    Thank you to KeenThemes for granting us a custom license to use their amazing Template Oswald for Django-SaaS UI

    KeenThemes HTML/CSS/JS components are allowed for use only within the Django-SaaS product
    and restricted to be used in a resealable HTML template that can compete with KeenThemes products anyhow.

    The Django-SaaS UI (HTML, CSS and JS components) based on this theme is allowed for use only within the Django-SaaS product
    and therefore cannot be used in derivative works/products without an explicit grant from the Riso Tech Team.
